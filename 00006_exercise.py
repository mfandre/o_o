# https://pynative.com/python-object-oriented-programming-oop-exercise/#h-oop-exercise-4-class-inheritance
# any question just let me know!

# if you are not begginer, you probably maintain some code and based on it:
# - where you can take advantages of use of inheritance
# - where you can use dependecy_injection
# Bring me examples to we discuss in the next meeting!
